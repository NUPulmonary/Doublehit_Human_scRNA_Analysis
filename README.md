# An analysis workflow for integrating human lung scRNA-seq data to investigate age-related heterogeneity
## Abstract

(TEMP) A dysfunctional response to inhaled pathogens and toxins drives a substantial portion of the susceptibility to acute and chronic lung disease in the elderly. Using genetic lineage tracing, heterochronic adoptive transfer, parabiosis, and treatment with metformin, we found the lung microenvironment drives age-related transcriptomic changes in alveolar macrophages that include reductions in cell cycle genes and increased expression of inflammatory genes.  These changes are independent of alveolar macrophage ontogeny, circulating factors or circulating monocytes.  Changes in the microenvironment, including changes in extracellular matrix composition, induce a resistance to proliferative signals from CSF2. Severe injury can induce the replacement of long-lived tissue resident alveolar macrophages with monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages, but both respond similarly to a subsequent injury.  These findings place the lung microenvironment upstream of the dysfunctional immune responses to inhaled environmental challenge in aging.  

Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) captures the transcriptomic phenotype of multiple cell populations within a tissue simultaneously. We utilized widely used R package “Seurat” and Canonical Correlation Analysis procedure to aggregate and analyze together data from 6 published dataset. Our integration included a total number of 38 samples, covering age from 17 to 88. The merged dataset provided sufficient statistical power and homogeneity to allow discovery of common aging biomarkers across distinct cell populations. We concluded that there were no heterogeneity or emerging new cell groups in avalor macrophages, which is consistent with our observation in mouse. Through pseudo bulk, we identified 673 differentially expressed genes between young and old samples and these genes were significantly overlapped with our bulk RNAseq analysis in mouse alveolar macrophages.

## Results

This workflow includes a [R file](code/foo.txt) to guide the readers step by step for our analysis workflow. The following only highlights some of the key findings:

The general workflow of our analysis is:
![](resources/flowchart1.png)

The total number samples is 52 and after QC control, the number of samples after filtering is 38:
![](resources/Initial_filtering.png)

We have a wide range of age from 17 to 88 years old and balanced among studies:

We use standard Seurat [SCTtransform](https://satijalab.org/seurat/v3.1/integration.html) pipeline to perform integration. After integration, we perform unbiased clustering on AM, it generated 9 clusters: 

```
AM.integrated <- FindNeighbors(AM.integrated, reduction = "pca", dims = 1:30, nn.eps = 0.5)
AM.integrated <- FindClusters(AM.integrated, resolution = 0.2, n.start = 10)

```

We do not see batch effects from individual studies:
![](resources/AM_tsne2.png)

However, cluster 3 and 0 include activated macrophage characterized by SPP1 and CCL3, lack of FABP4 expression. We removed these two clusters from our analysis and reclustered the data.
![](resources/AM_tsne3.png)

```
AM.integrated2<-subset(AM.integrated,ident=c(1,2,4,5,6,7,8))
AM.integrated2 <- FindNeighbors(AM.integrated2, reduction = "pca", dims = 1:30, nn.eps = 0.5)
AM.integrated2 <- FindClusters(AM.integrated2, resolution = 0.2, n.start = 10)
```
There were 7 clusters after cleaning. 
![](resources/AM_tsne4.png)

There was no imbalance of age within the group.
![](resources/AM_age.png)

Proven that there was no heterogeneity within age groups, we generated pseudo bulk RNA sequencing by averaging expression:

```
counts<-AverageExpression(AM.integrated,assays="integrated")
```

The DE analysis using edgeR package revealed 783 significantly down gene in aging and 215 up gene in aging between group <30 and >60 years old. The heatmap with hierarchical clustering shows samples with similar age grouped nicely together.
![](resources/heatmap1.png)

The trend was perserved if we used the same genes in all samples:

###Further cleaning:### 

we can further clean up our dataset by removing clusters 2 (CCL3, CCL4 cluster),5 (epithelial genes),6 (MoAM) from above object and perform DE analysis. In this case, there were even fewer upgenes in aging (66) and the down genes were similar (423). The trend was similar between <30 and >60 groups.
